## ⚙️ Experimental Setup & Detector Design

The experiment utilized a **Parallel Plate Avalanche Counter (PPAC)** to detect the ions after they passed through the analyzer.

### Detector Architecture
The detector was designed to operate at low gas pressures (~10 Torr) using Isobutane. It utilized a "transmission" geometry, allowing high-energy ions to pass through while generating a signal.

**Key Design Specifications:**
* **Gap Distance:** $3.2 \text{ mm}$ between Anode and Cathode to optimize the Townsend avalanche timing.
* **Position Sensing:** The cathode was segmented into **2.5 mm strips** (visible in Fig. 1) to provide spatial resolution of the ion beam profile.
* **Operating Principle:** Ions entering the chamber (indicated by the arrow) ionize the gas, creating an electron avalanche that is collected on the anode wires.

## 📐 Mathematical Framework (The Analyzer)

The analyzer functions as an electrostatic deflector. As the ion beam passes through the plates, the electric field exerts a force perpendicular to the direction of motion, deflecting the ions into a parabolic trajectory.

The net deflection $X$ is derived from the **Electrical Rigidity** of the beam:

$$X = \frac{1}{2 RE} [E] [z^2 + 2dz]$$

* Where $RE = \frac{2T}{q}$ (Electrical Rigidity)
* $T$ is the Kinetic Energy
* $q$ is the charge state
* $E$ is the Electric Field strength

This calculation allowed for the precise separation of fusion products from the primary beam.
